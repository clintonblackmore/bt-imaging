Overview
=======

bt-imaging is a work-in-progress set of tools to allow you to image Mac computers using BitTorrent (or `dd`).  It is being developed on Mac OS X 10.7, and may work on 10.6 or even 10.5, and should work on newer versions, too.

Take a look at our website (and documentation) at http://bt-imaging.robotclub.ab.ca, and this two-minute overview view: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qcIfEDsNGQ .

Ideas for Improvements
----------------------

If you have some ideas for improvements, please e-mail clinton.blackmore+bt-imaging@gmail.com or improve the code and let me know where it is!

Third-Party Tools
-----------------

I am including two compiled binaries of third-party tools with the scripts.

=== Pipe Viewer

[pv](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml) is a great utility for seeing how much data has gone through a pipe.  I'm using it so that when you restore a .cdr file using dd, you can see how far along the process is. `pv` is under an artistic license.

=== Transmission

[Transmission](http://www.transmissionbt.com/) is a BitTorrent client.  I'm including the command-line interface program `transmissioncli`, unchanged from Transmission 2.82, at present.  Transmission is under the GPL, with parts under an MIT license.

See the licenses folder for more information.
